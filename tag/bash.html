</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>If you're someone like me who learned coding in higher-level languages, like Python, R, and Java, bash can be quite strange. Luckily for you, bash has the same structures as other languages, albeit with different syntax. Note that this tutorial assumes you're familiar with basic bash commands for file manipulation.</p>
<p>This tutorial will cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bash script basics:</strong> Creating bash scripts, Variables, Backticks, User input, Arguments</li>
<li><strong>Control structures:</strong> For loops, If/else statements, While loops</li>
<li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> Reading a file line by line, Flags and options</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating Bash Scripts</h3>
<p>Bash scripts are simply a list of bash commands that the computer executes line by line, much like you use commands line by line. Create a bash script like any file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">nano myscript.sh</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Let's add these commands</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># Inside myscript.sh</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> Hello world!
touch newfile.txt
<span class="nb">echo</span> Hello new file &gt;&gt; newfile.txt
</code></pre></div>


<p>We can run bash scripts like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>bash myscript.sh
<span class="c1"># Hello world!</span>
<span class="c1"># Creates newfile.txt with &#39;Hello new file&#39; inside</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>It's as simple as that! But we can make our scripts more complicated!</p>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>Variables hold information, like numbers and strings (which include file names and paths). Think of them as placeholders.</p>
<p>You can set values to variables as in the following. Note that variable names are case-sensitive</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nv">a</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">10</span>
<span class="nv">A</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">5</span>
<span class="c1"># Note: a does not equal A</span>

<span class="nv">file</span><span class="o">=</span>/path/to/file.txt
<span class="nv">path</span><span class="o">=</span>/another/path
<span class="nv">newFile</span><span class="o">=</span>test.txt
</code></pre></div>


<p>You must ensure that there are no spaces between the variable name, the equals sign, and the value</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># Good: a=10</span>
<span class="c1"># Bad: a = 10</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>You use variables in scripts by adding a dollar sign ($) at the front of the variable name</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$a</span>
<span class="c1"># 10</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$file</span>
<span class="c1"># /path/to/file.txt</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Combine variables with strings</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>touch <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$path</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>/created_file.txt
<span class="c1"># Creates a new file called created_file.txt at /another/path</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Or combine variables</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>mv <span class="nv">$file</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$path</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>/<span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$newFile</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="c1"># Saves /path/to/file.txt at /another/path/test.txt</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>In general, it is good practice to place quotes around your variable names to prevent them from blending into your strings, e.g. <code>$varName</code> vs <code>"$var"Name</code> may have different outputs.</p>
<h3>Backticks (`)</h3>
<p>Commands within backticks will be run before the main command
For example, you know that <code>wc -l file</code> will output the number of lines within a given file, but if you are writing a script, you might not want the output to simply be a number. 
You can do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">echo</span> The number of lines is <span class="sb">`</span>wc -l file.txt<span class="sb">`</span> in file.txt
<span class="c1"># The number of lines is 1303 in file.txt</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Backticks also work for declaring variables</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nv">count</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="sb">`</span>grep -c <span class="s2">&quot;Apples&quot;</span> fruitList.txt<span class="sb">`</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> The number of apples is <span class="nv">$count</span>
<span class="c1"># The number of apples is 107</span>
</code></pre></div>


<h3>User input</h3>
<p>Getting user input is actually quite easy. Use the <code>read</code> command in front of the desired variable name, and you can use the input like a variable.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">echo</span> What is your name?
<span class="nb">read</span> name
<span class="nb">echo</span> Hello <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$name</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>!

<span class="c1"># What is your name</span>
<span class="c1"># $ Bailee</span>
<span class="c1"># Hello Bailee!</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Note that this is single line only. Pressing enter will submit the input.</p>
<h3>Arguments</h3>
<p>You know how commands like <code>ls</code> can take additional arguments such as <code>ls newDir</code> to list the files within <code>newDir</code>? You can make your script to accept arguments as well.
Arguments are denoted as <code>$1</code> for the first parameter, <code>$2</code> for the second, and so on. You use them like variables. 
Let's say you want to make a script that counts the number of items in a given directory</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># counter.sh</span>
<span class="nv">numItems</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="sb">`</span>ls <span class="nv">$1</span> <span class="p">|</span> wc -l<span class="sb">`</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> The number of items in <span class="nv">$1</span> is <span class="nv">$numItems</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>You can run it using:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>bash counter.sh newDir
<span class="c1"># The number of items in newDir is 125</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Note that flags (like <code>ls -l -h</code>) will be covered below.</p>
<h3>For Loops</h3>
<p>We use for loops to perform the same set of commands for a particular list of things (such as a sequence of numbers or a list of files).</p>
<p>Let's loop over this list of numbers. We generate this list using <code>seq</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span> x in <span class="sb">`</span>seq <span class="m">1</span> <span class="m">5</span><span class="sb">`</span>
<span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> My number is <span class="nv">$x</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
<span class="c1"># My number is 1</span>
<span class="c1"># My number is 2</span>
<span class="c1"># My number is 3</span>
<span class="c1"># My number is 4</span>
<span class="c1"># My number is 5</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>You can use a list of strings separated by spaces such as <code>egg milk flour</code>. If you have a string with spaces already, you must surround the string with quotes, such as <code>"brown egg" milk "wheat flour"</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span> str in <span class="sb">`</span><span class="s2">&quot;brown egg&quot;</span> milk <span class="s2">&quot;wheat flour&quot;</span><span class="sb">`</span>
<span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> Don<span class="s1">&#39;t forget to add the $str</span>
<span class="s1">done</span>
<span class="s1"># Don&#39;</span>t forget to add the brown egg
<span class="c1"># Don&#39;t forget to add the milk</span>
<span class="c1"># Don&#39;t forget to add the wheat flour</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Output from commands, such as <code>ls</code>, can be used in loops. Here you can output the first line within each file of a given directory</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nv">dir</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$1</span>
<span class="k">for</span> file in <span class="sb">`</span>ls <span class="nv">$dir</span><span class="sb">`</span>
<span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> File: <span class="nv">$file</span>
    head -n <span class="m">1</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
<span class="c1"># File: dog_names.txt</span>
<span class="c1"># Spot</span>
<span class="c1"># File: cat_names.txt</span>
<span class="c1"># Whiskers</span>
<span class="c1"># File: fish_names.txt</span>
<span class="c1"># Goldie</span>
</code></pre></div>


<h3>If/Else Statements</h3>
<p>At this moment, you're scripts are linear, meaning that A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D. With if/else statements, you can create more complex scripts where A -&gt; B and depending on B, you can go to C or D. 
Here is a simple if-else statement.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">echo</span> What is your name?
<span class="nb">read</span> name

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="nv">$name</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Tom&quot;</span> <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> Hello, you must be Tom
<span class="k">else</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> I don<span class="err">&#39;</span>t know you
<span class="k">fi</span>
</code></pre></div>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># What is your name?</span>
<span class="c1"># &gt; Tom</span>
<span class="c1"># Hello, you must be Tom</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Like declaring variables, spacing matters. You must have a space between the condition and the surrounding brackets, or you will get an error.</p>
<p>You can also omit the <code>else</code> statement if you don't need a command for that case.</p>
<p>For multiple <code>if</code> conditions within the same stack, use <code>elif</code> (i.e. else-if) following the initial <code>if</code>. The <code>else</code> statement can be omitted here as well, but if it is included, it must be at the end.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="nv">$name</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Tom&quot;</span> <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> Hello, you must be Tom
<span class="k">elif</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="nv">$name</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Brad&quot;</span> <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> Brad, please, come in
<span class="k">else</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> I don<span class="err">&#39;</span>t know you
<span class="k">fi</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Here are some examples of condition statements that would be useful. There are plenty more if you search for them on the internet.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="nv">$name</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Tom&quot;</span> <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>   <span class="c1"># If $name equals Tom</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="nv">$name</span> !<span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Tom&quot;</span> <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>   <span class="c1"># If $name does not equal Tom</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> -d raw_files <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span> <span class="c1"># If directory raw_files exists and is a directory</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> -f testFile.txt <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>  <span class="c1"># If testFile.txt exists and is a file</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> ! -f testFile.txt <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>    <span class="c1"># If testFile.txt does NOT exist OR testFile.txt is NOT a file</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="nv">$x</span> -ge <span class="m">10</span> <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>    <span class="c1"># If $x is Greater or Equal than 10</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="nv">$n</span> -lt <span class="m">15</span> <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>    <span class="c1"># If $n is Less Than than 15</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Combine multiple conditions into one if-statement using &amp;&amp; (AND) and || (OR).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="nv">$name</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Tom&quot;</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="nv">$name</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Brad&quot;</span> <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>    <span class="c1"># If $name equals Tom OR $name equals Brad</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="nv">$x</span> -gt <span class="m">10</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nv">$x</span> -lt <span class="m">20</span> <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>   <span class="c1"># If $x is greater than 10 AND less than 20</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Finally, you can put if-else statements with for loops. Let's say you ran an analysis on a batch different data files. Each analysis generates a separate results folder and a log inside that folder. You might want to read the logs of each analysis without having to go into each folder manually. You also want to note if the log file doesn't exist, suggesting that the analysis might have an error.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span> dir in <span class="sb">`</span>ls Results<span class="sb">`</span>
<span class="k">do</span>      
    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$dir</span>            
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> -f Results/<span class="nv">$dir</span>/log.txt <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
        cat Results/<span class="nv">$dir</span>/log.txt
    <span class="k">else</span>
        cat ERROR: NO LOG FOUND
    <span class="k">fi</span>
<span class="k">done</span> <span class="p">|</span> less
</code></pre></div>


<p>You can note the pipe after the for-loop statement. Like <code>head</code> and <code>sort</code>, output from loops can be shunted to other commands. Output from other commands can also be piped into loops.</p>
<h3>While-loops</h3>
<p>While-loops are similar to for-loops in that they repeat a set of commands. However, for-loops are finite. On the other hand, while-loops will repeat commands until their condition is met (<code>while &lt;condition is true&gt;; do something; done</code>). Think of them as if-statements that repeat forever until the condition is not true.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nv">secret</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="nv">$secret</span> !<span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;there is no cost without sacrifice&quot;</span> <span class="o">]]</span>
<span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;What is the password?&quot;</span>
    <span class="nb">read</span> secret
<span class="k">done</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Welcome!&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Here, you are asked for a password. If you put in the wrong password, you will be asked again until it is correct. Then you will receive a warm welcome. Note that this is not a good way to code passwords because a user can simply view the file for the right phrase.</p>
<h3>Reading a file line by line</h3>
<p>While loops can be used to read files line by line. To read a file, you must pipe the output of a command such as <code>cat</code> into the while loop. The format of the while loop should now be <code>while read varName</code>, shown below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># file.txt</span>
TO DO LIST:
<span class="m">1</span><span class="o">)</span> Eat
<span class="m">2</span><span class="o">)</span> Clean
<span class="m">3</span><span class="o">)</span> Walk the dog
</code></pre></div>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>cat file.txt <span class="p">|</span> <span class="k">while</span> <span class="nb">read</span> line<span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$line</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
<span class="c1"># TO DO LIST:</span>
<span class="c1"># 1) Eat</span>
<span class="c1"># 2) Clean</span>
<span class="c1"># 3) Walk the dog</span>
</code></pre></div>


<h3>Flags and options</h3>
<p>Adding flags and options can make your script not only more complex but also more user friendly, given that users don't need to input arguments in an exact order.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nv">report</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">0</span>
<span class="nv">file</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span>

<span class="k">while</span> <span class="nb">getopts</span> <span class="s1">&#39;rf:&#39;</span> flag
<span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$flag</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> in
        r<span class="o">)</span>  <span class="nv">report</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">1</span> <span class="p">;;</span>
        f<span class="o">)</span>  <span class="nv">file</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$OPTARG</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="p">;;</span>
        *<span class="o">)</span>  <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Unknown option. Exiting&quot;</span>
            <span class="nb">exit</span> <span class="p">;;</span>
    <span class="k">esac</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="nv">$report</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;1&quot;</span> <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
        <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Deleting&quot;</span> <span class="nv">$file</span> &gt;&gt; report.log
    <span class="k">fi</span>
    rm <span class="nv">$file</span>
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Let's go through this in chunks.
The following below are your variables. They don't necessarily need to match your flags, but they are useful for holding information if a flag is used or if a flag has an argument</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nv">report</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">0</span>
<span class="nv">file</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>This is another type of while loop. Here, flag will be the variable, and you're going to use <code>getopts</code> to loop through <code>abf:</code>, setting <code>$flag</code> as each flag.
Note that options followed by a colon (:) take their own arguments. Here the <code>-f</code> flag will take a file argument while <code>-a</code> and <code>-b</code> don't need arguments</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">while</span> <span class="nb">getopts</span> <span class="s1">&#39;rf:&#39;</span> flag
</code></pre></div>


<p>This is a case statement. Think of it as a large if-else stack, where we check if <code>$flag</code> matches any of the strings denoted as <code>&lt;string&gt;)</code>. Each case must end with double semicolons (;;). Use <code>$OPTARG</code> to get the argument of a flag. Finally <code>*)</code> denotes the commands for erroneous options. If there is an error, we exit. Otherwise, the rest of the script is run normally.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">case</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$flag</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> in
    r<span class="o">)</span>  <span class="nv">report</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">1</span> <span class="p">;;</span>
    f<span class="o">)</span>  <span class="nv">file</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="nv">$OPTARG</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="p">;;</span>
    *<span class="o">)</span>  <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Unknown option. Exiting&quot;</span>
        <span class="nb">exit</span> <span class="p">;;</span>
<span class="k">esac</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="nv">$report</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;1&quot;</span> <span class="o">]]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Deleting&quot;</span> <span class="nv">$file</span> &gt;&gt; report.log
<span class="k">fi</span>
rm <span class="nv">$file</span>
