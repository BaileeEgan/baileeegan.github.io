<h3>Assembling the cornrootworm transcriptome</h3>
<p>The western corn rootworm (<em>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</em>) and related species, the southern (<em>D. undecimpunctata</em>) and northern (<em>D. barberi</em>) corn rootworms are agricultural pests of crops, mainly corn as their names suggests. Most damage to the host plant is caused by larval feeding. <img alt="right" src="/images/dvv.jpg">
My work involves assembling the transcriptomes of these three species and analyzing the genes that may be involved in larval feeding or host location. An example of these genes are the CO2 receptors since western corn rootworm larvae are attracted to CO2 and may use CO2 gradients for long-range detection of corn roots. </p>
<h3>Predicting the structure of insect CO2 receptors</h3>
<p>Insect chemoreceptors, consisting of mainly odorant and gustatory receptors, represent an unusual family of chemoreceptors that share no homology with mammalian chemoreceptors. Due to several reaons, including difficulties with X-ray crystallography in solving membrane proteins and a lack of known homologous protein structures, the tertiary structures of insect chemoreceptors has long been unknown. Sequence coevoution analyses may be used to identify contacting residues in a folded protein and, thus, may help improve <em>ab initio</em> folding. This method has been used to predict the structure of the odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco), a highly conserved protein ubiquitously alongside odorant-binding receptors and may be useful for the CO2 receptors, another highly conserved set of genes among insects.</p>
<h3>Characterizing the gut and oral microbiomes of long-tailed macaques</h3>
<p>My undergraduate research in the lab of Dr. Hope Hollocher focused on studying the gut and oral microbiomes of long-tailed macaques, monkeys that live closely alongside humans in southeast Asia.</p>
